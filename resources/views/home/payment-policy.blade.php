Learners are expecting to complete all Lessons in the Lesson Packages within six (6) months of the purchase date (the &quot;Package Expiration Date&quot;). If there are any remaining Lessons that have not been completed on or before the Package Expiration Date, Speakede will send reminders to both the Learner and the Tutor prior to the applicable Package Expiration Date. The Learner may extend the Lesson Package on the Learner&rsquo;s Speakede Account before the applicable Package Expiration Date, but if the Learner fails to do so, then all remaining Speakede Tokens in the package will be sent to the Tutor, minus Speakede&apos;s Commission Fees.</span></p>

                    <p style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="color:#515164;font-size:10.5pt;">As a security measure, Speakede may impose transaction limits on some or all Learners and Tutors relating to the value of any transaction or disbursement, the cumulative value of all transactions or disbursements during a period of time, or the number of transactions per day or other period of time. We will impose these limits before any services are rendered if we determine it is necessary for security reasons or the prevention of fraud.</span></p>
                    <p style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="color:#515164;font-size:10.5pt;">Speakede reserves the right to void Speakede Token purchases if purchases are found to be fraudulent. This includes Speakede Tokens that have been redeemed from fraudulent Speakede gift card purchases.</span></p>
                    <h6 style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#ffffff;"><strong><span style="color:#313140;font-size:12pt;">8.2 Reservation of Rights for Erroneous Transactions</span></strong></h6>
                    <p style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="color:#515164;font-size:10.5pt;">Speakede reserves the right to seek reimbursement from any Tutor or Learner, if Speakede, in its sole discretion, determines that erroneous or duplicate transactions have occurred. Speakede may obtain such reimbursement by deducting from future payments owed to such Tutor, by reversing any Speakede Tokens to such Tutor&apos;s Tutor Wallet, or by seeking reimbursement from such Tutor by any other lawful means.</span></p>
                    <h6 style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#ffffff;"><strong><span style="color:#313140;font-size:12pt;">8.3 Prohibition on Friendly Fraud</span></strong></h6>
                    <p style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="color:#515164;font-size:10.5pt;">&quot;Friendly Fraud&quot; is when a person initiates a fraud dispute with a payment provider, claiming that their credit card (or other payment method) was not intended to be used. Because Speakede does not offer refunds, users that disagree with the policy have tried to use Friendly Fraud to receive a refund.</span></p>
                    <p style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="color:#515164;font-size:10.5pt;">This type of behavior is illegal and prohibited by all payment providers. Speakede also strictly opposes Friendly Fraud. If Friendly Fraud is discovered, the Learner&apos;s Speakede Account and Learner Wallet will be deactivated, purchased credits will be confiscated, and the Learner will be noted as a financial security risk.</span></p>
                    <p style="color:#ffffff;background-color:#ffffff;"><span style="color:#515164;font-size:10.5pt;">In the case of honest mistakes, Speakede can reverse the transaction. We strongly advise Learners to contact Speakede Customer Support to resolve any financial disputes.</span></p>
